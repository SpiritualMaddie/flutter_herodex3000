## 🌍 The Story

**The world after the invasion.**

An unknown invasion struck without warning. Internet. Devices. Communication. Society collapsed.

But in the chaos, the brilliant minds of HFL25-2 created the HeroDex Terminal — a simple but powerful application that enabled heroes and villains to collaborate. Together, they managed to slow the invasion.

Now the world is back online. Devices have awakened. But the fight isn't over.

To stop the invasion completely, humanity needs a new HeroDex — modern, stable, and accessible to all.

**That's where HeroDex 3000 comes in.**

### Key Design Patterns

**Repository Pattern**
- `SuperHeroApiRepository` - Abstracts API calls with CORS proxy fallback
- `FirestoreRepository` - Handles all Firestore CRUD operations
- `AuthRepository` - Manages Firebase Authentication

**Singleton Pattern**
- `AgentDataManager` - Centralized data access coordinator
- `SettingsManager` - Global settings with ChangeNotifier
- `FirebaseService` - Platform-aware Firebase service wrapper

**View Model Pattern**
- `AgentSummary` - Lightweight model for list/card displays
- `AgentSummaryMapper` - Transforms full models to summaries

**State Management**
- `AuthCubit` - Authentication state (logged out/loading/authenticated)
- `ThemeCubit` - Theme selection and persistence

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK 3.10.7 or higher** - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK 3.10.7 or higher** (bundled with Flutter)
- **Firebase Project** - [Create Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- **SuperHero API Key** - [Get API key](https://www.superheroapi.com/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpiritualMaddie/flutter_herodex3000.git
   cd flutter_herodex3000
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   API_URL=https://superheroapi.com/api
   API_URL_WITH_KEY=https://superheroapi.com/api/YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```
   
   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual SuperHero API key.

4. **Set up Firebase**
   
   a. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   
   b. Enable the following services:
      - Authentication (Email/Password)
      - Cloud Firestore
      - Analytics (optional)
      - Crashlytics (optional)
   
   c. Add your apps (Android, iOS, Web) and download configuration files:
      - Android: `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
      - iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`
      - Web: Configure via `firebase_options.dart`
   
   d. Run Firebase configuration:
      ```bash
      flutterfire configure
      ```

5. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**
   
   In Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId}/saved_agents/{agentId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Generate app icons and splash screens**
   ```bash
   dart run flutter_launcher_icons
   dart run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```

7. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # Android
   flutter run -d android
   
   # iOS
   flutter run -d ios
   
   # Web
   flutter run -d chrome
   
   # Windows
   flutter run -d windows
   ```

### Troubleshooting

**Build errors?**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
```

**Firebase connection issues?**
- Verify `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` are in correct locations
- Re-run `flutterfire configure`
- Check Firebase project authentication is enabled

**API not working?**
- Verify `.env` file exists in project root
- Check API key is valid at [SuperHeroAPI.com](https://www.superheroapi.com/)
- Ensure `.env` is listed in `pubspec.yaml` assets

## 🌐 Platform Support

### ✅ Fully Supported
- **Android** (Primary target, extensively tested)
  - All features working
  - Direct image loading (no CORS issues)
  - Crashlytics enabled
  - Native splash screen

### ⚠️ Partially Supported
- **Web** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
  - Search and navigation fully functional
  - ~60% of images load successfully (CORS limitations from SuperHeroDB CDN)
  - Graceful fallback to shield placeholders for blocked images
  - Crashlytics disabled (not supported on web)
  - *Tip: Scroll through roster/search a few times if images don't load initially*

- **Windows** (Desktop)
  - Core functionality works
  - Limited testing performed
  - Recommended for development/testing only

### 🔄 Expected to Work (Untested)
- **iOS** (iPhone/iPad)
  - App Tracking Transparency (ATT) implemented
  - Crashlytics enabled
  - All features should work
  - *Not tested due to lack of Mac/iOS simulator*

- **macOS** (Desktop)
  - Firebase services configured
  - Responsive layouts implemented
  - *Not tested due to hardware limitations*

- **Linux** (Desktop)
  - Flutter support available
  - *Not tested*

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Web Limitations**
- **Image Loading**: SuperHeroDB.com blocks CORS proxy requests for some images. This is a CDN limitation, not an app bug. On mobile platforms, all images load perfectly without proxies.
- **CORS Proxy Fallback**: The app tries multiple proxies (`corsproxy.io`, `allorigins.win`, direct) before showing placeholder.
- **Performance**: Slower than native due to proxy overhead.

**Mobile Optimizations**
- Direct API and image requests (no proxy needed)
- Crashlytics error reporting
- Native splash screens

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

HeroDex 3000 includes comprehensive unit tests covering critical data flows:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Test Coverage

**Test Files:**
- `test/agent_model_test.dart` - AgentModel JSON parsing and serialization
- `test/agent_summary_mapper_test.dart` - View model mapping logic
- `test/biography_model_test.dart` - Empty data handling
- `test/powerstats_model_test.dart` - Safe parsing of nullable stats
- `test/appearance_model_test.dart` - Malformed data handling

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ JSON deserialization from SuperHero API
- ✅ Null safety (handles "null" strings, empty strings, actual nulls)
- ✅ AgentModel → AgentSummary mapping
- ✅ Alignment detection (hero/villain/neutral)
- ✅ PowerStats safe parsing
- ✅ Edge cases (long names, empty arrays, malformed data)


## ♿ Accessibility

### Implemented Features

**Swipe-to-Delete Discovery Tooltip**
- First-time hint overlay on Roster screen
- Auto-dismisses after 25 seconds - time to read
- Manual dismissal via tap or close button
- High contrast
- Persistent setting (never shows again after dismissal)
- Shows only when roster has agents

**Visual Accessibility**
- High contrast theme options (Hero/Villain/Neutral) - tested via [WEBAIM - Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Large, clear typography throughout
- Icon + text labels on buttons
- Color-coded alignments (cyan/red/purple)

**Interaction Accessibility**
- Swipe gestures with visual feedback
- Error states with clear messaging

### Planned Improvements (Future Versions)

**Delete Button on Detail Screen**
- Current limitation: Swipe-to-delete is the only removal method
- Accessibility concern: Not all users can perform swipe gestures
- Planned: Add explicit "Remove from Roster" button on AgentDetailsScreen
- Note: Ran out of time before deadline, marked as high-priority improvement

**Neutral Agent Theming**
- Current limitation: Neutral agents use villain styling
- Planned: Purple accent colors for neutral alignment
- Planned: Include neutral agents in Home screen statistics

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Web Platform
**Image Loading Issues**
- **Problem**: SuperHeroDB.com CDN blocks CORS proxy requests
- **Impact**: ~40% of images fail to load on web
- **Workaround**: Scroll through lists multiple times; some images load on retry
- **Fallback**: Shield placeholder icons for blocked images
- **Note**: This is a third-party CDN limitation, not an app bug. All images work on mobile.

**CORS Proxy Reliability**
- Multiple proxies attempted in order: `corsproxy.io` → `allorigins.win` → direct
- Proxy services can be slow or temporarily unavailable
- Recommendation: Use mobile app for best experience

### Missing Features (Ran Out of Time)

**Neutral Agent Integration**
- Neutral agents saved to roster but not highlighted with distinct colors
- Not included in Home screen statistics breakdown
- Planned for v1.1.0

**Delete Button on Detail Screen**
- Current: Swipe-to-delete only (accessibility concern)
- Planned: Explicit "Remove from Roster" button on AgentDetailsScreen
- Priority: High (accessibility improvement)

### Untested Platforms
- iOS: ATT implemented but not tested (no Mac/iOS simulator)
- macOS: Firebase configured but not tested
- Linux: Expected to work but not validated

### Firebase Setup Required
- Users must create their own Firebase project
- Cannot use developer's Firebase instance (security rules)
- Requires manual configuration of Auth, Firestore, Analytics, Crashlytics
